1.	Write a C++ function to Check if an inputted year is a Leap Year.
2.	Write a C++ function to Check whether a Number is Palindrome or Not.
3.	Write a C++ function to Check Whether a Number is Prime or Not. A prime number is a number only divisible by itself and 1.
4.	Write a C++ function to Convert Binary Number to Decimal without using the shift operator.

6.	Write a nested loop that outputs the following. This nested loop contains only 2 for loops.

A <br />
AA <br />
AAA <br />
AAAA <br />

7.	Write a nested loop that outputs the following. This nested loop contains only 2 for loops and at most 1 if and an else conditional statement.

A <br />
AA <br /> 
AAA <br /> 
AAAA <br />
AAA <br />
AA <br />
